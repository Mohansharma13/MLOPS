# MLflow: Open Source Machine Learning Lifecycle Management

MLflow is a platform for managing the entire machine learning lifecycle, from experimentation to production deployment. It offers features for:

* **Experiment Tracking:** Track, compare, and reproduce experiments by logging parameters, metrics, artifacts, and code versions.
* **Project Packaging:** Package your ML projects with code and dependencies for seamless sharing and reproducibility.
* **Model Serving:** Develop and deploy models to various serving environments for real-world use cases.
* **Model Registry:** Manage the complete model lifecycle, including versioning, staging, and transitioning models to production.

MLflow integrates with popular ML libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, scikit-learn, and more, making it adaptable to your existing workflow.

**Benefits:**

* **Reproducibility:** Track experiment details and code versions for easier replication and debugging.
* **Collaboration:** Share and compare experiments with your team to accelerate development.
* **Model Management:**  Centrally manage model versions and deployments.
* **Scalability:** Track and manage large-scale ML pipelines effectively.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Installation:**

   ```bash
   pip install mlflow
```

Simple Experiment Tracking Example:
```
import mlflow

# Start a new MLflow run
with mlflow.start_run():
    # Log parameters
    mlflow.log_param("alpha", 0.1)
    mlflow.log_param("l1_ratio", 0.2)

    # Log metrics
    mlflow.log_metric("mse", 0.05)

    # Log artifacts (e.g., model files)
    mlflow.log_artifact("model.pkl", "artifacts")

```
Explore the MLflow UI:
